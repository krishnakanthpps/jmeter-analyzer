jmeter_csv_analyzer
-------------------

This is a small utlity script written in python that I use for analyzing performance test results.

Usage:
./jmeter_csv_analyzer.py -f <jmeter_sample_results_file.csv>

Creates a file <jmeter_sample_results_file>_analyzed.csv which contains a csv-formatted "table" a little like JMeters Aggregate Report. The file can then be opened in e.g. Numbers/Calc/Excel for drawing graphs etc.
